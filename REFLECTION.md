Explain your code in detail:
    I ran out of time to explain my code in detail

Reflect on your coding process:
    one function at a time

Discuss challenges and solutions: 
    I had difficulty wrapping my head around the checkUsername instructions, i eventually skipped it and returned to it later.
    I had trouble getting the selected radio inputs with the data-correct data type. i eventaully found out how after an hour of searching online.

Consider improvements: 
    my code is currently overwriting the localstorage data, the solution is probably along the lines of adding the existing score to the localstorage instead of replacing it but i ran out of time to implement it.
    The new player button not being hidden when its not needed, ill probably have to implement a toggle instead of an if-else statement
